# MemeKeeperBot
Non-serious twitter bot to keep my Python skills up to date.

This was an idea that I had gotten from one of my coworkers to keep my Python skills fresh. This bot will detect when an internet meme is 
becoming popular and "buries" it via a Twitter bot. The handle is @wherememesdie. Every day the bot will read from the RSS feed of a popular 
internet website to gather information and will perform an automatic photoshop based on whatever that information may be. After doing all 
of this it will sleep for 24 hours and then repeat the process. At the time of writing this (3/30/17) the bot has been up and running for 
about a month.
